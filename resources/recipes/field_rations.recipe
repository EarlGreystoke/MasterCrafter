Name: Field Rations
Types: Rations
Components: Salt, Flour, Water
Description: This hard tack, while not especially satisfying, keeps the body going and one bite is enough to fill the stomach of a full-grown man. When consumed, this ration allows the adventurer to get the most out of any respite. If a creature spends a Hit Dice during the rest, they may add 1d8 to the total number of hit points recovered.
