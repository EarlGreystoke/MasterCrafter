Name: Voidroot
Description: These jet-black plants produce a thick mucous which seem to absorb surrounding light, giving them a darker-than-life appearance. Caution should be taken when preparing elixirs, as mishandling can leave ones-self susceptible to a fugue-like state of crushing despair. Exclusively found in swamps. VALUE25-35VALUE GP
Types: Gas, Poison, Potion, Stabilizer
Gas: The area within this gas is pitch-black, as if under the effects of the Darkness spell, for the duration.
