Name: Voidroot
Description: These jet-black plants produce a thick mucous which seem to absorb surrounding light, giving them a darker-than-life appearance. Caution should be taken when preparing elixirs, as mishandling can leave ones-self susceptible to a fugue-like state of crushing despair. Exclusively found in swamps. VALUE15-25VALUE GP
Types: Gas, Poison, Stabilizer
Gas: The area within this gas is pitch-black, as if under the effects of the Darkness spell, for the duration.
Poison: A creature that fails its saving throw to avoid the effects of this poison becomes stunned for the duration of the poison's effects. The creature may repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending this effect on a success. If the creature takes damage from any source, this effect immediately ends.
Stabilizer: Reduces the chance of spontaneous detonation.
