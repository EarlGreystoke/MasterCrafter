Name: Runic Attunement Slot
Description: Runes requires a creature to form a bond with them before their magical properties can be invoked. This bond is called attunement, and all runes have a prerequisite number of runic attunement slots which they take up as part of the attuning process.SPACESPACEAttuning to a rune requires a creature to spend a Short Rest focused on only that rune while being in physical contact with it. If the Short Rest is interrupted, the attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of this short rest, the creature gains an intuitive understanding of how to activate the rune's magical properties, as well as any necessary Command words, and may choose a weapon, piece of armor, or item to imbue with the power of the rune.SPACESPACEA rune may be attuned to only one creature at a time, and creatures have a set number of attunemtent slots, as outlined in the runic attunement table below. Any attempt to attune to a rune while lacking the required number of empty runic attunement slots fails; the creature must end its attunement to a number of runes which satisfies the new rune's runic attunement slot requirements. Additionally, a creature can't attune to more than one copy of a rune.SPACESPACEA creature's attunement to a rune ends if the creature no longer satisfies the prerequisites for attunement, if the item inbued with the rune's power has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24 hours, or if the creature dies. A creature can also voluntarily end attunement by spending another Short Rest focused on the rune.SPACE
