# MasterCrafter
Python-gui for generating semi-random crafting recipes for Dungeons and Dragons

  This project is meant to be a (relatively) easy way to develop and deploy a crafting option for your D&D players. The script uses three main types of files to do this: Component files, Recipe files, and Type files. All of these can be edited, removed, or added easily to adapt to the player or campaign - so long as they follow the generic formula.
  
1) Component files represent the array of components that can be combined to generate objects. Components that are submitted are compared to see if they share common possible types (see below). Any combination of components can **only** generate objects of a shared type. Components may also possess modifier types, which may alter the likelihood of certain object types being crafted. These files have 4 parts:
  - Name: The name of the Component
  - Description: A flavorful description of the component
  - Types: a list of the types of objects that this component can be used to craft
  - Type effects: a brief description of what effect the component may add to the component

2) Type files are the basic types of objects that can be created from components. While different combinations of components may all generate the same object type, these types must be defined as a file before that type of object is crafted. Although components may alter the exact effect of its object type, the basic characteristics and use of an object is inherited from its type. Type files have the 3 aspects:
  - Name: Name of the type
  - Description: A basic description of how the object type is used by a player
  - 

3) Recipe files are templates for what may be crafted. You may develop your own but the files also auto-generate every time you stumble-on a combination of components that make an object. For this reason, each player may like to have their own set of MasterCrafter folders so that known recipes aren't shared between players. Recipe files have the 4 parts as well:
  -Name: The Name of the recipe. When a new recipe is discovered, you will be asked to name the combination. This name is then used to write a new recipe file that can be pulled back up from the GUI.
  -Description: A basic description of the object generated by this recipe. Unique recipes may have specific descriptions, but procedurally generated recipes inherit their descriptions from the object type
  -Requirements: The specific components required to make this recipe. Unique recipes may have components that are *not* found in the component files but generated recipes will list the exact components used during the initial crafting.
  -Type: The type of object this recipe generates. Since a combination of components may generate more than one type of object, this is used to track which types of a component combination have already been discovered.
  
  Yay! Okay, but how do you use it? Great question. I'll get back to you on that....
